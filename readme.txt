Add a browseable, flexible directory of the sites in a WP Multisite network. Each subsite gets its own page.

== Description ==

Multisite Directory provides a customizable Network-wide site directory for WordPress Multisite installations from the Network's main site. You can categorize subsites in your Network, add full-length descriptions and featured images to them, and more. Theme developers can customize the look and feel of the site directory using all the tools they're already familiar with.

Each time a new site or blog is added to your Network, a corresponding entry in the site directory is added, too.

Site directory entries are implemented as a hierarchical custom post type in the main site. These pages can be categorized with a custom "subsite category" taxonomy. This combination allows maximum flexibility while providing the tightest integration with existing WordPress core features, without any custom tables or unexpected side effects.

== Installation ==

Multisite Directory is for WordPress Multisite installations only. Do not use this plugin for single-site installs.

To manually install Multisite Directory:

1. Upload the unzipped `multisite-directory.zip` file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Customize your site directory in the main site's Dashboard.
